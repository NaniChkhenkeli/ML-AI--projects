## Layer 5, Head 8

This attention head appears to focus on subject-verb relationships. The subject of a sentence consistently attends strongly to its main verb.

Example Sentences:

- "The cat [MASK] on the mat." (cat attends to "sat"/"lay")
- "A bird [MASK] in the sky." (bird attends to "flew"/"soared")

## Layer 7, Head 3

This head seems to track adjective-noun relationships, where adjectives pay particular attention to the nouns they modify.

Example Sentences:

- "The bright [MASK] shone through the window." (bright attends to "sun"/"light")
- "She wore a beautiful [MASK] to the party." (beautiful attends to "dress"/"necklace")
